Not “AI as a chatbot,” and not “AI as a magic answer machine,” but AI as a **structured workflow** that behaves like a multi-desk research process—with explicit roles, explicit handoffs, explicit controls, and explicit stopping rules.\n","\n","When we say “multi-desk research,” we are describing a familiar institutional routine. A portfolio manager or CIO asks a cross-asset question that cannot be answered responsibly from a single angle. The macro desk frames the regime and policy reaction. The rates/FX desk interprets the transmission mechanism through yields, curves, and currency channels. The equity desk translates the regime into valuation and earnings consequences. The credit desk tests funding conditions, refinancing risk, and spread dynamics. Then a senior person synthesizes these views into one coherent memo, and a risk or review function challenges it: “What are we assuming? What do we not know? What would falsify this thesis? What must be verified before we act?”\n","\n","This notebook operationalizes that workflow. It doesn’t just produce a report; it demonstrates an **architecture**. The committee should evaluate the notebook in the same way they evaluate an operating model: Is the process legible? Are the controls real? Are the failure modes anticipated? Can we reproduce and audit what happened? Does the system behave like a disciplined team rather than a single opaque black box?\n","\n","That is the purpose of this notebook: to show that AI can support institutional research by providing **structured coverage, faster iteration, and consistent governance**—without pretending to be a substitute for human judgment.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**What This Notebook Does in Plain Terms**\n","\n","This notebook takes one cross-asset research question—“How should a multi-asset portfolio manager think about a sudden, persistent inflation surprise combined with tightening financial conditions?”—and runs a process that mirrors a real multi-desk workflow.\n","\n","The process has five stages:\n","\n","**1) Intake**  \n","The system receives a query and constraints. Constraints matter because a memo written for an institutional PM differs from a memo written for retail investors. In this notebook, constraints include the audience (“Institutional PM / CIO”), a conservative risk posture (“avoid unsupported claims”), a time horizon (“3–6 months”), and a deliverable style (“mechanism-first; explicit assumptions and open items”).\n","\n","The point is not to “prompt cleverly.” The point is to define the operational frame so the system produces outputs that match how we work.\n","\n","**2) Desk selection and routing**  \n","A real team does not always involve every desk. Some questions require macro + rates/FX only. Others require equity + credit. So the system performs a structured selection step and then routes the question through the relevant desks.\n","\n","In our case, it chooses four desks:\n","- **MACRO**\n","- **RATES_FX**\n","- **EQUITY**\n","- **CREDIT**\n","\n","Routing is not ad hoc. It is state-driven. The notebook maintains an explicit state variable called something like **pending_desks**. That list is the queue. Each desk runs exactly when it is at the front of the queue. When it finishes, it is removed from the queue. When the queue is empty, the process moves forward to synthesis. This is a real operational control: it prevents confusion about which steps have completed and why the system moved forward.\n","\n","**3) Desk memo production**  \n","Each desk writes a memo in a structured format:\n","- a thesis,\n","- key points (mechanisms),\n","- risks,\n","- assumptions,\n","- open items,\n","- recommended next actions.\n","\n","This is the heart of “multi-desk AI.” We are not asking one model to write one long memo. We are asking the system to produce separate, role-specific memos that reflect different institutional lenses. That reduces single-thread narrative drift and increases coverage.\n","\n","It also improves auditability. If someone questions why the synthesis recommended a certain hedge, we can point to the rates/FX memo. If someone questions the rationale for reducing leverage, we can point to credit and liquidity risks. Each output is attributable to a named desk node.\n","\n","**4) Synthesis**  \n","After all desk memos exist, the system produces a unified cross-asset synthesis. This is analogous to a senior research analyst combining desk notes into a coherent narrative:\n","- What is the shared view across desks?\n","- Where do desks diverge?\n","- What is unknown or unverified?\n","- What actions are plausible given the constraints?\n","\n","Critically, the synthesis step is not meant to create “confidence theater.” It is meant to produce a memo that is explicit about uncertainty.\n","\n","**5) Red team and supervisor gate**  \n","This is where the notebook becomes institutional rather than “AI demo.”\n","\n","In a real firm, the most dangerous failure mode is not that we miss a detail. The most dangerous failure mode is that we convince ourselves of a story, with no explicit verification plan, and we act before we have measured what matters.\n","\n","So the notebook adds two controls:\n","\n","- **Red team:** A deliberate adversarial critique step. The red team attacks the synthesis: missing evidence, hidden assumptions, scenario gaps, ambiguous triggers, non-implementable recommendations. This step exists to make sure the system does not drift into unchallenged narrative.\n","\n","- **Supervisor gate:** A final decision node that can set one of three outcomes: **APPROVE**, **REVISE**, or **REJECT**. This is a practical institutional control. It forces the workflow to end with an explicit gate, the way we end real research processes with a decision about readiness.\n","\n","If the supervisor chooses **REVISE**, the workflow loops—but in a bounded way. It will rerun desks (or parts of the analysis) for a limited number of revision rounds, and then it will stop. This is not optional. It prevents infinite loops and ensures the system behaves predictably.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Why We Built It This Way: Architecture Over Chat**\n","\n","Most people’s mental model of AI in finance is “a chatbot that answers questions.” That is not how serious work gets done. Serious work gets done by workflows: people, roles, checks, routing, and artifacts.\n","\n","This notebook uses LangGraph to explicitly model that workflow. In practical terms, LangGraph gives us something we do not get from a normal prompt:\n","\n","**A visible topology.**  \n","We can draw the system’s process as a graph: intake → desk router → desks → synthesis → red team → supervisor → revision plan → end. That diagram is not decoration. It is a governance artifact. It tells us what the system is allowed to do, in what order, and under what conditions it stops.\n","\n","**State-driven behavior.**  \n","The system moves because state changes, not because text “sounds right.” A desk runs because it is in the pending queue. Synthesis runs because the queue is empty. The process ends because termination_reason is set to a terminal value. This matters because it makes behavior predictable and testable.\n","\n","**Bounded loops.**  \n","Revision loops are allowed, but bounded. This is exactly how we manage real research cycles: we allow iteration, but we do not allow indefinite churn. The notebook enforces that.\n","\n","**Artifact export.**  \n","Every run writes artifacts: a run manifest (metadata), a graph spec (topology), and a final state (outputs + trace). This is the difference between “AI wrote something” and “we can audit what the AI did.”\n","\n","---\n","\n","**What the Committee Should Notice in the Output**\n","\n","The report produced by this notebook looks like a multi-desk packet because it is constructed like one.\n","\n","There are four independent desk memos. Each memo speaks in the language that desk would use. The synthesis consolidates those views and identifies shared mechanisms and disagreements. The red team explicitly challenges what is missing or weak. The supervisor gate tells us whether the memo is ready, and if not, what must be improved.\n","\n","That structure is not cosmetic. It changes the risk profile of AI-assisted research. Instead of a single narrative, we get:\n","- separate perspectives,\n","- explicit gaps,\n","- explicit follow-ups,\n","- explicit readiness decisions.\n","\n","If you think about committee review processes, this mirrors how we build confidence: not by saying “we are confident,” but by showing what we know, what we don’t know, and what we would check before acting.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**What This Notebook Does Not Do (And Why That Is Good)**\n","\n","To present this responsibly, we must say what it does not do.\n","\n","**It does not fetch real-time market data.**  \n","This notebook is about architecture, not about live data. In a production setting, we would add data connectors and validated datasets. Here we focus on the workflow and governance.\n","\n","**It does not create trading instructions.**  \n","The deliverable is a research note with mechanisms, risks, and verification needs. It may suggest hedging categories or risk posture adjustments, but it does not execute trades. That boundary is intentional.\n","\n","**It does not guarantee factual correctness.**  \n","No AI system should be treated as a source of truth. The notebook explicitly produces “unknowns” and “verification checklists.” That is the correct institutional stance: AI assists reasoning, humans verify facts and decide.\n","\n","**It does not hide uncertainty.**  \n","The red team and supervisor functions exist precisely to surface uncertainty.\n","\n","In other words, this system is designed to be useful in a real firm not because it pretends to be right, but because it is designed to be reviewable.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**How the System Avoids the Classic AI Failure Modes**\n","\n","Most AI failures in professional settings come from predictable patterns:\n","\n","**Failure mode 1: Narrative drift**  \n","A single model produces a coherent story that is not well grounded. Because it reads well, humans over-trust it.\n","\n","**Notebook control:** multi-desk decomposition + red team challenge.  \n","Separate memos reduce single-thread drift. The red team forces explicit critique.\n","\n","**Failure mode 2: Missing coverage**  \n","A single answer overlooks an important channel—credit transmission, FX spillovers, policy reaction asymmetry, liquidity constraints.\n","\n","**Notebook control:** explicit desk roles + routing.  \n","Coverage is built into the topology.\n","\n","**Failure mode 3: Non-auditable output**  \n","A chatbot answer cannot be traced. You cannot tell what steps happened or why.\n","\n","**Notebook control:** trace log + final state + artifacts.  \n","We export the run manifest, graph topology, and final outputs. We also keep the trace.\n","\n","**Failure mode 4: Endless iteration or premature stop**  \n","AI systems can loop without end or stop without justification.\n","\n","**Notebook control:** bounded loops + termination reasons.  \n","Revision is allowed but capped. End conditions are explicit.\n","\n","**Failure mode 5: False precision**  \n","The output sounds quantitative but is not tied to verifiable measures.\n","\n","**Notebook control:** governance addons with trigger scaffolds and scenario scaffolds.  \n","Even if the model is qualitative, the system forces the structure of quantitative triggers and scenarios as “Not verified” placeholders. That is the right discipline: identify what must be quantified before action.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Why This Matters for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**\n","\n","Your bosses will not adopt AI because it can write paragraphs. They will adopt AI if it improves one of the following:\n","\n","- speed of coverage,\n","- consistency of process,\n","- clarity of assumptions,\n","- quality of review,\n","- auditability and governance,\n","- ability to scale across topics.\n","\n","This notebook targets those.\n","\n","In a real week, a CIO may ask multiple cross-asset questions: inflation, growth shocks, geopolitics, liquidity events, credit stress, FX spillovers. The bottleneck is often not intelligence; it is process capacity. Multi-desk coverage is expensive in time and coordination.\n","\n","An AI orchestrator can help by doing a first structured pass:\n","- It produces desk-style memos quickly.\n","- It forces an explicit synthesis.\n","- It runs a red team critique automatically.\n","- It generates a verification checklist and scenario scaffold.\n","- It creates an audit trail.\n","\n","That means a senior analyst can spend time where humans add the most value:\n","- selecting the right data to verify,\n","- evaluating the quality of the evidence,\n","- deciding which scenarios are material,\n","- translating into portfolio constraints and client mandates,\n","- judging risk appetite under governance.\n","\n","This is the correct partnership model: AI as a process accelerator, not a decision-maker.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**How to Explain the Graph to the Committee Without Jargon**\n","\n","When you present the notebook, you can describe the graph in one sentence:\n","\n","**“We built a workflow that mimics a multi-desk research process: intake the question, route it to desks, synthesize outputs, red-team the synthesis, and then run a supervisor gate that either approves or sends it back for bounded revisions.”**\n","\n","Then connect each node to an institutional role:\n","\n","- **INTAKE:** research coordinator receiving the CIO question and constraints.\n","- **DESK_ROUTER:** operations logic deciding which desk runs next based on pending coverage.\n","- **MACRO / RATES_FX / EQUITY / CREDIT:** desk analysts producing memo components.\n","- **SYNTHESIS:** senior analyst drafting the cross-asset narrative.\n","- **RED_TEAM:** risk/review challenging the memo.\n","- **SUPERVISOR:** research head deciding approve/revise/reject.\n","- **REVISION_PLAN:** operational step to rerun a subset of desks under bounded iteration.\n","- **END:** explicit stop with a recorded termination reason.\n","\n","This mapping is intuitive. It helps the committee see that the “AI system” is not a monolith. It is a structured process that resembles how they already operate.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**What “State” Means Here (In Business Terms)**\n","\n","“State” is just the notebook’s way of keeping a disciplined case file. The state contains:\n","\n","- the query and constraints,\n","- which desks were selected,\n","- which desks remain pending,\n","- the memos produced so far,\n","- the synthesis and red team critique,\n","- the supervisor decision,\n","- the revision round count,\n","- the trace of events.\n","\n","In a firm, this is the equivalent of a shared folder or case-management system where you can see what’s done and what remains. The difference is that here the state directly controls execution. That is why behavior is predictable.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**What the Artifacts Mean for Governance**\n","\n","The notebook exports three required artifacts plus the full report:\n","\n","**run_manifest.json**  \n","This is the run metadata: when it ran, which model, what configuration, what environment versions. In a governance setting, this is essential. It lets us reproduce a run and explain differences over time.\n","\n","**graph_spec.json**  \n","This is the workflow specification: which nodes exist, how they connect, and the Mermaid diagram. It is a control document: it defines what the system is allowed to do.\n","\n","**final_state.json**  \n","This is the full case file: inputs, outputs, memos, synthesis, critique, decision, trace. This is what you would retain if you wanted to audit what was produced and why.\n","\n","**research_report.txt**  \n","This is the human-readable printable memo pack.\n","\n","If a committee member asks, “Can we show exactly what happened?” the answer is yes: we have a state file and a trace.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**How This Evolves Into Production**\n","\n","This notebook is Notebook 10 in a sequence because it represents the most “institutional” topology. Earlier notebooks teach components: loops, refusal boundaries, critique cycles, tool-augmented nodes, regime machines, committee aggregation, hub-and-spoke drafting, document routing, and event-driven monitoring. Notebook 10 synthesizes these ideas into a supervised multi-agent orchestrator.\n","\n","To move from this architecture into production, we would do three things:\n","\n","**1) Add validated data inputs**  \n","Desk memos would reference specific datasets (inflation measures, financial conditions indices, curves, spreads, earnings revisions). The “trigger scaffold” would be filled with real metrics, thresholds, and alert logic.\n","\n","**2) Harden controls**  \n","We would formalize “verification status” fields and require the system to tag claims as supported vs assumed vs open. We would add policy constraints for what the system can recommend.\n","\n","**3) Implement human sign-off**  \n","The supervisor decision in production would be a human gate. The AI can propose revise/approve recommendations, but the decision to distribute or act belongs to the human governance chain.\n","\n","Those upgrades are straightforward because the architecture already separates roles, routing, and artifacts. The notebook is intentionally built to make that progression natural.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**How to Position This to the Committee**\n","\n","If you want to be direct with your bosses, position the notebook as:\n","\n","**A repeatable research process that scales coverage, improves structure, and produces audit artifacts.**\n","\n","It is not a “prediction engine.” It is not “automated portfolio management.” It is a disciplined workflow that produces a research pack and forces explicit verification needs.\n","\n","In other words:\n","\n","**This notebook shows how AI can behave like a multi-desk team, not by being smarter than humans, but by being organized like humans.**\n","\n","That is the core claim. And it is exactly what you can show in the notebook: the visible graph, the desk memos, the synthesis, the red team critique, the supervisor gate, and the exported audit artifacts.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Closing: The Value Proposition in One Paragraph**\n","\n","The value of this notebook is operational. It demonstrates that AI can accelerate the front end of institutional research: quickly generating desk-style coverage, producing a structured synthesis, forcing adversarial critique, and producing a verification checklist—while keeping the process bounded, inspectable, and auditable. The committee does not need to believe AI is “right.” They only need to see that the system produces better structure, faster coverage, and stronger governance around uncertainty. That is what this notebook delivers, and that is why the architecture is the primary learning artifact—not the prose of any single memo.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pF_yDrZ7h6_y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##1.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"yeIrVzqFh7fZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**CELL 1 — Environment setup, dependency hygiene, and reproducibility guardrails**\n","\n","Cell 1 exists to solve a problem that looks “boring” but is responsible for many notebook failures in front of committees: dependency conflicts. Google Colab comes with preinstalled libraries, and those preinstalled versions can change over time. If we import libraries carelessly, we can trigger subtle runtime errors—exactly like the `langchain.debug` issue you encountered. So Cell 1 is deliberately written as a defensive foundation: it installs only what we need, pins versions where appropriate, avoids unnecessary upgrades of packages that Colab depends on, and prints an environment fingerprint so we can audit what ran.\n","\n","Pedagogically, this is the first lesson of institutional AI: before we talk about “agents,” we need **reproducibility** and **inspectability**. If the committee asks “Could we reproduce this?” we should be able to point to a deterministic seed, stable package versions, and a logged environment. This is why we set random seeds, stabilize hashing where possible, and record versions for `langgraph`, `langchain-core`, and `anthropic`. These choices make later results attributable to a controlled configuration rather than to random drift.\n","\n","Cell 1 also establishes the global imports that every later cell relies on: typing utilities (`TypedDict`, `Literal`), standard libraries (`json`, `hashlib`, `uuid`, `datetime`), and any display utilities required for Mermaid visualization. The goal is separation of concerns: later cells should focus on architecture (state, nodes, routing) rather than re-declaring low-level utilities.\n","\n","Finally, Cell 1 is where we align to the project’s security and operational requirements. The API key is retrieved via `userdata.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")` (all caps), which is the Colab-safe pattern that avoids hardcoding credentials. In short: Cell 1 is the notebook’s “operations layer.” It is not glamorous, but it is what makes the rest of the system trustworthy in a professional setting.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"R_A4WZpJWV_a"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# CELL 1/10 — Colab-safe bootstrap (conflict-avoiding) + version locks + legacy shims\n","# Goal: avoid Colab preinstall collisions (esp. langchain/langchain_core globals) and keep runtime stable.\n","\n","import sys, subprocess, os, platform, json, hashlib, uuid, time\n","import datetime as _dt\n","from typing import TypedDict, Literal, Dict, Any, List, Optional, Callable, Tuple\n","\n","os.environ[\"PYTHONHASHSEED\"] = \"7\"\n","\n","def _pip_install(pkgs: List[str]) -> None:\n","    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"-q\", \"--upgrade\"] + pkgs)\n","\n","def _version(pkg: str) -> str:\n","    try:\n","        import importlib.metadata as md\n","        return md.version(pkg)\n","    except Exception:\n","        return \"missing\"\n","\n","def _clear_modules(prefixes: List[str]) -> None:\n","    # Remove already-imported modules to ensure pins take effect without restarting runtime.\n","    for m in list(sys.modules.keys()):\n","        if any(m == p or m.startswith(p + \".\") for p in prefixes):\n","            del sys.modules[m]\n","\n","# --- Hard pins for this project (KNOWN COMPATIBILITY SET) ---\n","# We pin langchain + langchain-core together to avoid the `langchain.debug` AttributeError in Colab.\n","PINS = {\n","    \"langgraph\": \"0.2.39\",\n","    \"langchain\": \"0.3.14\",\n","    \"langchain-core\": \"0.3.40\",\n","    \"anthropic\": \"0.34.0\",      # minimum; allow >=\n","    \"packaging\": \"24.2\",        # stable Version parsing\n","}\n","\n","# Install only what is missing/mismatched to reduce churn\n","need = []\n","if _version(\"langgraph\") != PINS[\"langgraph\"]:\n","    need.append(f\"langgraph=={PINS['langgraph']}\")\n","if _version(\"langchain\") != PINS[\"langchain\"]:\n","    need.append(f\"langchain=={PINS['langchain']}\")\n","if _version(\"langchain-core\") != PINS[\"langchain-core\"]:\n","    need.append(f\"langchain-core=={PINS['langchain-core']}\")\n","\n","if _version(\"packaging\") != PINS[\"packaging\"]:\n","    need.append(f\"packaging=={PINS['packaging']}\")\n","\n","# anthropic: accept >= minimum (install if missing)\n","if _version(\"anthropic\") == \"missing\":\n","    need.append(f\"anthropic>={PINS['anthropic']}\")\n","\n","if need:\n","    _pip_install(need)\n","\n","# Clear cached modules so newly installed versions are used even without runtime restart\n","_clear_modules([\"langchain\", \"langchain_core\", \"langgraph\", \"anthropic\"])\n","\n","# Imports AFTER pins\n","from packaging.version import Version  # noqa\n","import langchain  # noqa\n","\n","# Legacy globals expected by some langchain_core code paths (Colab sometimes ships a variant lacking these)\n","if not hasattr(langchain, \"debug\"):\n","    langchain.debug = False\n","if not hasattr(langchain, \"verbose\"):\n","    langchain.verbose = False\n","\n","from google.colab import userdata  # noqa\n","from IPython.display import HTML, display  # noqa\n","\n","from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END  # noqa\n","\n","print(\"BOOTSTRAP_OK:\", {\n","    \"python\": sys.version.split()[0],\n","    \"platform\": platform.platform(),\n","    \"langgraph\": _version(\"langgraph\"),\n","    \"langchain\": _version(\"langchain\"),\n","    \"langchain-core\": _version(\"langchain-core\"),\n","    \"anthropic\": _version(\"anthropic\"),\n","    \"langchain.debug\": getattr(langchain, \"debug\", None),\n","    \"langchain.verbose\": getattr(langchain, \"verbose\", None),\n","})\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"TkUyHJjWD9wj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771507305124,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":5580,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"3b3ca3a0-96f8-4813-82ca-02856c09f082"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["BOOTSTRAP_OK: {'python': '3.12.12', 'platform': 'Linux-6.6.105+-x86_64-with-glibc2.35', 'langgraph': '0.2.39', 'langchain': '0.3.14', 'langchain-core': '0.3.40', 'anthropic': '0.82.0', 'langchain.debug': False, 'langchain.verbose': False}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.CONFOGURATION"],"metadata":{"id":"aOzs2vNWiEjE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###2.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"_Z7ptw6JiIcM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**CELL 2 — Configuration and explicit state schema (TypedDict) as the contract**\n","\n","Cell 2 defines the notebook’s operating contract. In this project, the contract is explicit: the system is state-driven, auditable, deterministic, and modular. To enforce that, we separate “configuration” from “state.” Configuration is what we choose before the run (model lock, maximum steps, maximum revision rounds, desk order, retry policies). State is what changes during the run (pending desks, completed desks, memos produced, synthesis, red team critique, supervisor decision, termination reason, trace log).\n","\n","The most important artifact in this cell is the **TypedDict state schema**. A TypedDict turns the state into a structured object with named fields. This is not just style. It is a governance control. It prevents hidden variables and undocumented behavior. Every node reads from and writes to the same declared state object. That means we can audit: “What did the Macro desk see?” “What did Synthesis use?” “Why did Supervisor decide REVISE?” The answers are in the state.\n","\n","In institutional workflows, ambiguity is risk. Typed state reduces ambiguity. It also supports modularity: if we add another desk later (for example, “Commodities” or “EM”), we extend the state schema predictably. If we add a new control (for example, “evidence_tags”), we add it as a state field, and all nodes can adopt it without hacks.\n","\n","Cell 2 also declares the enumerations and controlled vocabularies: desk names, termination reasons, and supervisor decisions. This matters because routing depends on these values.

This is the foundation of modularity. Every node has the same interface, which allows the graph to connect nodes predictably and allows us to test them in isolation if needed.\n","\n","The next part of the cell defines the desk memo nodes: Macro, Rates/FX, Equity, and Credit.

Cell 7 adds governance explicitly.\n","\n","First, Synthesis takes the desk memos and produces a cross-asset summary with structured sections: consensus, divergences, unknowns, actionable recommendations, and confidence. This mirrors what a senior analyst does: not repeating desk notes, but integrating them into a coherent picture.\n","\n","Second, Red Team is an adversarial check. It does not produce new analysis; it challenges the synthesis: missing evidence, hidden assumptions, scenario gaps, and lack of implementable triggers. This is critical because the most common failure mode in AI-assisted research is overconfidence driven by narrative fluency. Red teaming forces the system to surface what must be verified before action.\n","\n","Third, Supervisor is a gate: APPROVE, REVISE, or REJECT. This is not a rhetorical flourish. It is an operational control. If the output is not ready, the system must say so explicitly, and it must say what to do next.\n","\n","Fourth, Revision Plan updates state to rerun specific desks under bounded iteration. This makes the process realistic. In real research, you rarely accept a first draft. You revise, but you also cannot revise forever. The notebook therefore caps revision rounds and sets explicit termination reasons such as MAX_REVISION_ROUNDS_REACHED.\n","\n","A key engineering detail is “normalization”: if the model returns incomplete content, the cell fills minimum required sections deterministically. This prevents empty reports and ensures the output always contains the governance structures the committee expects: verification checklist, trigger scaffolds, and scenario scaffolds labeled as “Not verified.”\n","\n","In short: Cell 7 is the governance heart of the notebook. It demonstrates that AI can support research while still respecting institutional controls.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MzaMhrkuimFO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND

This is the notebook’s “operating model.” It is also the most important cell to show the committee because it is the clearest proof that this is not a chatbot.\n","\n","The graph has an entry point (INTAKE) and an explicit END node. The explicit END matters because professional workflows must stop for a reason and record the reason. “We stopped because we ran out of steps” is different from “We stopped because the supervisor approved.” The termination reason is part of the audit trail.\n","\n","Conditional routing is also central. We use routing functions that read state, not free-form text. For example, the Desk Router routes to a desk if `pending_desks` is non-empty, otherwise to Synthesis. The Supervisor routes to Revision Plan if decision is REVISE and revision rounds remain, otherwise to END. These are deterministic rules, and they are bounded.\n","\n","This cell also reintroduces the loop safety: we enforce maximum step caps and revision caps in routing logic. That prevents GraphRecursionError and ensures the graph cannot run indefinitely.\n","\n","Finally, Cell 8 renders the Mermaid diagram. This is not decoration. It is the visual contract of the system. When you present to the committee, the diagram is your map: you can point to each node and explain what role it plays, and you can show where governance controls live.

Portfolio managers must verify the persistence of inflation (vs. transitory shock), the transmission mechanism of tightening into real economic activity, and the policy response function before repositioning, as the outcome depends critically on whether central banks prioritize price stability or financial stability.\n","KEY_POINTS:\n","  - Mechanism 1 – Equity Margin Compression: Persistent inflation erodes real wages and input costs faster than pricing power can offset; combined with tightening financial conditions (higher rates, wider credit spreads), cost of capital rises. For equities, this creates a dual headwind: lower earnings growth + higher discount rates = multiple contraction. Cyclicals and high-leverage names are most vulnerable; defensive/low-beta names may outperform but not decouple entirely.\n","  - Mechanism 2 – Bond Duration Trap: Rising inflation expectations push nominal yields higher; tightening financial conditions accelerate this move. Existing bond portfolios suffer mark-to-market losses. Reinvestment risk improves (higher yields available), but the transition period is painful. Credit spreads typically widen in tightening cycles, creating additional losses in corporate/high-yield bonds.\n","  - Mechanism 3 – Credit Stress Transmission: Tightening financial conditions (higher rates, reduced liquidity, wider spreads) increase refinancing risk for leveraged corporates and weaker sovereigns. Inflation erodes real cash flows. The combination creates a 'credit crunch' dynamic where spreads widen not just from repricing but from genuine default risk increase, particularly in cyclical and lower-rated segments.\n","  - Mechanism 4 – Real Assets as Hedge: Inflation-sensitive assets (commodities, inflation-linked bonds, real estate with pricing power) may provide partial hedges, but only if inflation is truly persistent and not demand-destructive. Tightening financial conditions can suppress commodity demand (demand-destruction effect), creating a conflict: inflation supports commodity prices, but recession risk suppresses them.\n","  - Mechanism 5 – Policy Response Uncertainty: The outcome hinges on whether central banks maintain tightening (prioritizing inflation control) or pivot to accommodation (prioritizing financial stability). A 'Volcker-style' commitment to inflation control would support long-duration real assets but crush equities and credit. A pivot would reverse these dynamics.

The system we built is not a chatbot. It is a structured workflow that behaves like a multi-desk research process: intake, desk memos, synthesis, red team challenge, supervisor gate, bounded revision, explicit termination, and exported artifacts. That design choice is the foundation for governance, because governance is always easier when the process is explicit.\n","\n","Moving from this notebook to a fully auditable, governed implementation with humans in the loop is less about adding “more AI” and more about strengthening three layers: **evidence**, **controls**, and **accountability**.\n","\n","First, we strengthen the evidence layer. Today, this notebook is architecture-first: it demonstrates the workflow and produces a packet with structured gaps and verification needs. In production, the same desks must be able to reference validated inputs. That means integrating approved data sources (economic releases, curve data, spreads, earnings revisions, funding indicators) and binding the system to a “data provenance record” for every run. Each memo should carry explicit tags: what claims are supported by data pulled in this run, what claims are general background, and what claims are assumptions. The key is not to make the AI “more confident,” but to make the output **traceable to sources**.\n","\n","Second, we strengthen the controls layer. The notebook already contains the essential controls: bounded loops, explicit supervisor decisions, red team critique, and exported artifacts. In production, we turn these into enforceable gates. The supervisor node becomes a true “release control” with formal rules: a memo cannot be distributed unless (a) key sections are present, (b) verification checklists are populated with real metrics and thresholds, and (c) risk disclosures are included. We also formalize stop conditions: if evidence is insufficient, the correct outcome is “REVISE” or “REJECT,” not a polished narrative. The system should be biased toward refusing to finalize when verification is missing, because that is the safe institutional behavior.\n","\n","Third, we strengthen accountability with a human-in-the-loop workflow. In production, humans are not “optional reviewers.” They are the owners of decisions and the signatories of outputs. The most practical implementation is a two-step loop. Step one is AI-assisted draft generation: the system produces desk memos, synthesis, and red team critique quickly and consistently. Step two is human review and sign-off: desk analysts validate the desk-specific claims and fill in the verification triggers with real metrics, while a senior reviewer approves distribution. In other words, the AI system accelerates preparation and structure; humans own factual verification and actionability.\n","\n","To make this auditable, we treat every run like a case file. The notebook already exports `run_manifest.json`, `graph_spec.json`, and `final_state.json`. In a governed deployment, these artifacts become mandatory records stored in a controlled repository with retention rules. We add run identifiers, reviewer identifiers, and a structured “approval record” that captures who approved what and when. We also log any overrides: if a human changes a recommendation, we record the change and the rationale. This is how you achieve auditability: not by trusting the model, but by capturing the process that produced the deliverable and the humans who took responsibility for it.\n","\n","Finally, we extend governance from “single run auditability” to “model lifecycle governance.” Over time, models change, prompts drift, and market regimes change. A governed system must track versions, run-to-run differences, and performance of the process itself. That means establishing an evaluation suite: not a leaderboard, but a set of institutional tests for completeness, consistency, refusal behavior, and risk disclosure. The committee should understand this as the same discipline we apply to any model risk management program: documented controls, documented limitations, periodic reviews, and clear escalation paths.\n","\n","The path forward is therefore straightforward and operational. We keep the same topology and strengthen the production boundary: validated data inputs, enforceable gates, and human sign-off integrated into the workflow. This notebook is already the correct skeleton for that outcome because it is state-driven, inspectable, bounded, and artifact-producing. With evidence provenance, formal control gates, and human accountability added, it becomes not just a demonstration of multi-desk AI, but a practical blueprint for governed research at institutional standard.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tv8ReGkpWL8u"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Ql1xoTBmXDWe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
