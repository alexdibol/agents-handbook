The objective is not to deliver financial advice, and it is not to impress the reader with complexity for its own sake. The objective is to teach the student what it means to build an agentic workflow as an explicit system: a controlled process with state, roles, routing, and termination. The motivating domain is personal finance because it is the most natural setting in which the limitations of naive prompting become obvious. Personal finance requests arrive incomplete, ambiguous, and underspecified. A user might provide income but not expenses, savings but not liabilities, goals but not horizons. In professional settings, the first step is never “answer the question.” The first step is triage: determine what you know, determine what you do not know, and decide what must happen next. Notebook 1 turns that commonplace professional pattern into a concrete, runnable architecture.\n","\n","The pedagogical value for the user is threefold. First, the notebook forces architectural thinking. Instead of writing one prompt that tries to do everything, the workflow is decomposed into roles that are easy to reason about, easy to debug, and easy to modify. Second, it forces explicitness. The system stores information in a structured state object, and decisions are driven by that state rather than by hidden conversational momentum. Third, it forces control. The system includes a retry loop with a strict bound. That may sound like a small detail, but it introduces an essential discipline: real agent systems must have termination conditions. Without termination, “autonomy” becomes unbounded execution, which is not intelligence but instability.\n","\n","A key principle in this notebook is that agents are not magical. Agents are modular components embedded inside a graph. A model call is not an architecture. An architecture is a pattern of dependencies: what runs when, under what conditions, and with what shared context. LangGraph is used precisely because it lets us represent that architecture explicitly. The student is learning one tool and one abstraction. The point is not to explore an ecosystem of frameworks. The point is to internalize the graph mental model so deeply that new architectures become simple variations of the same underlying primitives.\n","\n","The notebook also makes a strong claim about what matters in the classroom: speed and clarity. The strict use of **claude-haiku-4-5-20251001** is not a technical footnote; it is an instructional choice. If the model is slow, the attention of the room collapses. If the feedback loop is delayed, students stop interacting with the architecture and start waiting for outputs. For pedagogy, responsiveness often matters more than maximal reasoning depth. This notebook is designed to be run live, modified live, and debugged live. It is therefore grounded in the principle that we teach architecture by experimentation, not by proclamation.\n","\n","The visualization requirement is not optional. The architecture must be seen. The Mermaid graph is the first-class learning artifact, and the code is secondary. A student should be able to look at the diagram and explain the system: what the nodes represent, what the conditions represent, where loops occur, and where the system terminates. The notebook includes a programmatic Mermaid renderer because visualization is part of correctness. If the graph does not render, the pedagogical objective fails. This is also a subtle but important lesson in professional engineering practice: explanations and diagrams are not decoration. They are instruments of coordination and review. In real teams, the architecture is what gets debated first.\n","\n","From the student’s perspective, Notebook 1 should leave behind a durable mental model. The mental model is that an agentic system is not a single prompt. It is a controlled process composed of three essential elements: **state**, **agents**, and a **graph**. If the student truly learns these definitions, the rest of the series becomes a matter of combining and extending them.\n","\n","What follows is a definition-driven description of the pipeline itself, written to make those primitives precise.\n","\n","**The pipeline in this notebook is a graph-based triage loop.** It begins with a user message and ends with a structured representation of the information plus a set of follow-up questions when the information is incomplete. The pipeline is not “linear,” even though it looks simple, because the next step is chosen conditionally. The intake node can route forward or route into a loop depending on what the system discovers. That conditional control is exactly what makes it a graph, not a chain.\n","\n","To understand the pipeline, we start with definitions.\n","\n","**A state is a structured representation of the system’s current knowledge and progress.** In this notebook, state is implemented as a typed dictionary with explicitly named fields. The most important pedagogical point is that state is not the conversation. State is the system’s own internal data structure that persists across nodes. It is inspectable and modifiable. It is the system’s memory in the most literal sense: a collection of variables that can be read, updated, and tested. In the notebook, the state includes fields such as the original user input, accumulating working notes, a boolean flag indicating whether information is complete, a retry counter, and a place to store final output. These fields are not “nice to have.” They are the mechanism through which the architecture becomes controllable.\n","\n","State serves three functions. First, it records evidence: what the user said and what agents have produced so far. Second, it enables decision-making: routing depends on `info_complete` and `retry_count`. Third, it enables debugging: if a run produces unexpected behavior, the student can inspect the state to see which node wrote what and why the router chose the path it chose. In a pure chat setting, those internal choices are opaque. In a graph setting, they are explicit.\n","\n","A second definition is equally important.\n","\n","**An agent is a role-defined transformation that reads state and writes state.** In this notebook, an agent is not an “entity” with autonomy. It is a node function with a name, a prompt (system instruction), and a predictable contract. The contract is simple: given the current state, the agent produces an output and appends it to working notes. Optionally, a post-processing hook updates specific fields such as `info_complete` or `retry_count`. This is the pedagogical heart of modularity. The student learns that an agent should have a narrow responsibility and a clear effect on state.\n","\n","The notebook contains three agents.\n","\n","The **Intake agent** is responsible for diagnosis. It reads the current working notes (which include user input and any prior outputs) and determines whether essential information is missing. Its output is not primarily advice. Its output is a classification expressed in a way the system can use. In this notebook, the intake agent is instructed to explicitly write the word “MISSING” when essential information is absent. That design is intentionally simple and robust for teaching: it creates a clear signal for downstream routing. The post-processing hook for intake scans the output and sets `info_complete` based on whether “MISSING” appears. In more advanced notebooks, this heuristic will evolve into structured schemas and validators, but the pedagogical idea is the same: an agent produces an output, and the system extracts a decision signal from that output to drive control flow.\n","\n","The **Clarification agent** is responsible for targeted questioning. It only runs when intake indicates incompleteness. It asks concise follow-up questions designed to fill the gaps. It also increments the retry counter through a post-processing hook. This teaches another essential idea: an agent node can be used to modify state even when the user is not actively responding in the loop. The retry counter exists to prevent endless cycling. It turns the loop into a bounded procedure. Again, the details are simple because the principle is the goal.\n","\n","The **Structuring agent** is responsible for organization. Once information is sufficiently complete, this agent converts the accumulated notes into a structured representation: income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and goals. This does not require optimization. It is a transformation from unstructured to structured. Pedagogically, this is important because students learn that many valuable applications of LLMs in finance are not “predictive” tasks but “structuring” tasks: turning messy inputs into clean, reviewable representations.\n","\n","The third foundational definition is:\n","\n","**A graph is an explicit model of control flow: a set of nodes connected by edges that define what can happen next.** In LangGraph, a graph is constructed by adding nodes (agent functions) and edges (transitions) and then compiling the result into an executable object. The key property of a graph is that the next step is not necessarily fixed. The pipeline is a graph because it contains conditional edges and a cycle. When the intake node completes, the system does not simply proceed to the next node. Instead, a routing function reads the state and chooses the next node: clarify or structure. This choice is not made by the model implicitly; it is made by the architecture explicitly.\n","\n","The graph in Notebook 1 has one entry point and one terminal path, but it also has a loop. The entry point is intake. After intake, the routing function examines `info_complete` and `retry_count`. If information is incomplete and the retry limit has not been reached, the graph routes to clarification. Clarification then routes back to intake. If information is complete, or if the retry limit has been reached, the graph routes to structuring and then terminates. This is the simplest possible demonstration of a nontrivial graph. It already contains the core ingredients that make agentic architectures powerful: feedback, conditionality, and termination.\n","\n","This definition-driven framing is the essence of what the pipeline achieves for the user. It turns the concept of “agents” into something that can be built, inspected, and understood as a system. The student learns that good agent design begins not with clever prompts but with clear state, clear roles, and clear routing logic. The student also learns that a diagram is not optional. The diagram is the mental model made visible. If you can narrate the diagram, you understand the system. If you cannot narrate the diagram, you are still guessing.\n","\n","In later notebooks, we will expand the architecture in disciplined steps: multiple termination paths, hard branching vetoes, parallel committees, tool-augmented nodes, retrieval routers, and supervised multi-agent constellations. But the student should recognize that all of those expansions are variations on what is learned here. The primitives remain state, agents, and graphs. The system becomes more complex only by adding nodes, expanding state, and enriching the topology. That is the point of starting here. Notebook 1 is not boring when understood correctly. It is the first place where the student stops thinking of AI as a chat interface and starts thinking of AI as an engineered workflow.\n","\n","This is why the notebook is worth the time. It gives the student a stable conceptual map from problem to architecture to implementation. It shows that practical agentic systems are not mystical. They are explicit. They are composable. They are debuggable. And they are teachable.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pF_yDrZ7h6_y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##1.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"yeIrVzqFh7fZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","The first cell establishes the operational environment for the notebook and signals an important pedagogical commitment: we are building a system, not writing a script. Installing the required libraries is not just a technical step; it makes explicit which tools define the conceptual boundary of the exercise. The student sees immediately that the system rests on three foundations: **LangGraph** for orchestration, **Anthropic’s Claude 4.5** for reasoning, and core Python typing for structured state. This is deliberate. The goal is to minimize conceptual sprawl. One orchestration tool, one model family, one typed state representation.\n","\n","This cell also reinforces the idea that an agentic architecture is not abstract theory. It is executable. When students run this cell and see the environment initialize, they understand that what follows is not metaphor. It is code that governs behavior. This matters for pedagogy because agent discussions often remain at the conceptual level. By starting with concrete execution, we anchor the lesson in practice.\n","\n","Another subtle but important objective of this cell is psychological. When the notebook prints confirmation messages, it provides feedback. Fast feedback builds trust in the system. In a classroom setting, responsiveness preserves attention. The fact that the model choice is strict and pinned to a specific identifier is also an instructional statement: architectural stability is more important than chasing the latest release. Students should learn that reproducibility and clarity outweigh novelty.\n","\n","Finally, this cell signals modularity. By isolating installation and imports, we make the computational boundary visible. Everything that follows will operate inside this boundary. The student begins to internalize that an agent system is assembled from components. Each component must be named, imported, and understood. The architecture does not emerge spontaneously.

At first glance, this may appear procedural, but pedagogically it introduces a critical architectural distinction: the separation between **cognitive engine** and **system structure**.

By isolating model configuration in its own cell, we teach that the model can be swapped without rewriting the graph.\n","\n","Using Colab’s userdata retrieval is equally instructive.

Its purpose was never to deliver financial advice. Its purpose was to demonstrate, in the most concrete and executable way possible, how an agentic workflow can be built as an explicit graph governed by state, routing, and termination rules. By the end of this notebook, the student should no longer see an “agent” as a personality or a chatbot, but as a modular transformation embedded within a larger structure.\n","\n","The core achievement of this notebook lies in clarity. We defined a structured state object that carries the evolving knowledge of the system. We defined agents as role-specific transformations that read and write that state. We defined a graph that determines what happens next, not by conversational guesswork, but by explicit routing logic. Most importantly, we introduced a bounded retry loop, showing that intelligent systems must have limits. The presence of a retry counter and a termination path demonstrates that architecture is about control as much as it is about reasoning.\n","\n","From a user perspective, this notebook accomplishes something subtle but powerful. It turns a messy, ambiguous financial input into a controlled triage process. Instead of attempting to answer prematurely, the system first evaluates completeness, asks for clarification when necessary, and only then proceeds to structure information. This mirrors how disciplined professionals operate. The student learns that responsible workflows are staged workflows. The model does not decide the sequence arbitrarily; the graph does.\n","\n","Pedagogically, this notebook establishes the invariant principles that will govern the entire series. Every future example will still revolve around state, agents, and graphs. What will change is topology. We will introduce branching vetoes, parallel committees, tool integrations, retrieval routers, and supervisory constellations. But the mental model remains identical. Once a student understands how a conditional retry loop operates, more complex patterns become variations on a theme rather than entirely new concepts.\n","\n","Another lasting lesson is that architecture is visible. The Mermaid diagram is not decoration. It is a representation of the system’s logic. Being able to read and explain that diagram is a core competency. In professional environments, clarity of architecture determines whether systems can be audited, extended, or trusted. This notebook begins cultivating that literacy.\n","\n","Finally, the strict use of a fast, pinned model reinforces an essential truth: intelligence does not arise from model scale alone. It arises from structure. By keeping the cognitive engine stable and lightweight, we emphasized that the graph is the primary artifact. The student leaves this notebook understanding that scalable agentic systems are built deliberately, with defined roles and controlled transitions. That understanding is the foundation upon which all subsequent notebooks will expand.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tv8ReGkpWL8u"}}]}
